class EspressoCzar(MP):
    """ Three years into the future...

    You are a PhD student at Cornell University and have recently been
    elected to manage the CS Department coffee supply as the Espresso Czar. In
    other words, you are now the go-to person whenever the Gates Hall espresso
    machine is empty. Congrats!

    With the CS Department's shared love of coffee and 'round-the-clock work
    ethic, your colleagues will enter the kitchen all throughout the day and
    (rather quickly) deplete the coffee supply.

    In keeping up with the demand, you order small coffee bean shipments
    throughout the day and get notified upon delivery from DeliveryGuys. When
    notified, you immediately let him try to refill the coffee machine.

    To keep track of coffee usage, you rigged the machine with a bell to notify
    you when a CoffeeDrinker tries to make a cup of espresso.

    The fill capacity of the machine is specified by the constant FILL_CAPACITY
    and it uses up the coffee beans in a FIFO manner. In technical terms,
    "refilling the machine" means to add 1 unit of coffee beans to the machine,
    and "making a cup of espresso" means to use up 1 unit of coffee beans. The
    fill tank of the espresso machine may be represented by a data structure.

    Your task is to apply your CS 4410 mastery of synchronization to efficiently
    prevent CoffeeDrinkers from making coffee when the machine is empty and
    block DeliveryGuys from refilling the machine when it is already full.

    Clarification points:
    - 1 unit of coffee beans makes 1 cup of espresso.
    - Each shipment contains 1 unit of coffee beans (also written as "refill unit")
    - Your colleagues are civilized and only make 1 cup at a time.
    - Choose your data structure carefully! Keep in mind that general correctness
    is just as important as the synchronization-safety.
    - The goal of this assignment is to ensure you understand the internals of
    thread-safe data structures, so be explicit with protection!
