# Below are a few multiple-choice questions about the behavior of this program.
# Look for A2 - Multiple Choice on CMS and record your responses there.
# You will also need to modify the code below and submit this file.
#
# This program simulates a game between two teams. Each team presses
# their button as fast as they can. There is a counter that starts at
# zero; the red team's button increments the counter, while the blue
# team's button decrements the counter. They each get to press their
# button 10000 times. If the counter ends up positive, the read team
# wins; a negative counter means the blue team wins.
#
# This game is inherently boring; it should always end in a draw. However the
# provided implementation behaves somewhat differently. Run the script a few
# times and observe the end counter.
#
# 2.1) When both threads terminate, what is the largest possible score?
#       a) 10,000
#       b) 20,000
#       c) Could be ANY positive number
#       d) 0
#       e) 10,001
#
# 2.2) What other values can the score be when both threads have terminated?
#       a) -10,000 | 0 | 10,000
#       b) -20,000 | 0 | 20,000
#       c) Any integer between -10,000 and 10,000
#       d) Any integer between -20,000 and 20,000
#       e) Any integer
#
#   Note: "|" means "or" in this context
#
# TODO: Add appropriate synchronization such that updates to the
# counter occur in a critical section, ensuring that the end game counter
# is always 0 when the two threads terminate.
#
# Your synchronization must still allow interleaving between the two threads.
